      "Tony Medley\trotten\ttonymedley.com\tAnother anti-intellectual attempt at comedy with jokes that concentrate on male nudity, stupid ingenuity, gay sex, and excrement. Unfortunately, irreverence does not always equate to quality humor.\tNovember 6, 2006\n",
      "Jeanne Kaplan\tfresh\tKaplan vs. Kaplan\tMost of this film is designed to entertain tall 6-year-olds, my darling husband included. He laughed himself silly and I wanted to cover my head so no one would see me.\tNovember 6, 2006\n",

      "Mike Ward\tfresh\tRichmond Times-Dispatch\tReviewing Borat is kind of like doing an autopsy on a clown. Some scenes are borderline awkwardly unbearable, but then you look down and see the bright red nose or big floppy shoes (or in this case a yellow thong bathing suit). And you laugh.\tNovember 3, 2006\n",

      "Mick LaSalle\tfresh\tSan Francisco Chronicle\tIt's so inventive, so rich with comic moments, so outrageous, so shocking and unexpected, and so willing to be offensive that it consistently leaves viewers off balance -- and howling.

      "Carla Meyer\tfresh\tSacramento Bee\tThe outrageous comedy Borat holds a mirror up to the casual bigotry within American society. But it's a funhouse mirror, and a cracked one at that, making the film hilarious, fascinating and troubling all at once.\tNovember 3, 2006\n",

      "Steven Rea\tfresh\tPhiladelphia Inquirer\tBorat leaves no ethnicity, no religious or social order (well, maybe one or two) unmocked.

      "Gary Thompson\tfresh\tPhiladelphia Daily News\tBorat is a combination of mockumentary and Jackass -- Cohen gulls folks into thinking he's a real reporter so he can film spontaneous interactions with actual people.\tNovember 3, 2006\n",
      "Nick Rogers\tfresh\tThe Film Yap\tBigotry never will go away. So when its temporary takedown is as savagely witty and wise as Sacha Baron Cohen's mad-scientist creation, even those of us with the best intentions might as well furiously laugh at man's inhumanity to man.\tNovember 3, 2006\n",
      "Roger Moore\tfresh\tOrlando Sentinel\tBorat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is as fearless as mockumentaries get.\tNovember 3, 2006\n",
      "Shawn Levy\tfresh\tOregonian\tIt's not well made, nor does it tell an especially memorable story, nor is its humor always (as if this mattered) fair or grown-up, but it's nevertheless howlingly, painfully, gaspingly funny.\tNovember 3, 2006\n",
      "Lisa Rose\tfresh\tNewark Star-Ledger\tCrude, confrontational and stunningly sick, it's a movie made in the fringe tradition of Pink Flamingos, featuring a performer who seems to be willing to do anything for the camera.\tNovember 3, 2006\n",
      "Jack Mathews\tfresh\tNew York Daily News\tPut on two pairs of underwear and try to stay dry through one of the most uproariously -- or, in the case of the nude wrestling scene between Borat and his morbidly obese producer, disgustingly -- funny movies in a very long time.\tNovember 3, 2006\n",
